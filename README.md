Weâ€™re <b>greedy</b> when grocery shopping.

15 percent of perishable products go to waste in grocery retailing due to damage and spoilage. In a world where almost 1 billion people remain undernourished, this is ethically unjustifiable.

Dynamic pricing is seen everywhere nowadays; from Uber to Lyft to Michigan's football game yesterday, it's shown to be extremely successful. To combat excess food waste within the grocery industry, <b>bestb(u)y</b> provides a platform for groceries to implement expiration-date based pricing (EDBP) to their stores.

Implementing this system heavily benefits both consumers and grocery stores. For consumers, produce and products with expiration dates will be cheaper, allowing individuals to get discounts on products. For grocery stores, studies show that gross profit increases in scenarios where EDBP is implemented. 

The question isn't <b>why</b> groceries haven't implemented EDBP, the question is <b>how</b>. We've created the answer.
